        <h2>Abstract:</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout history, the arts and creative practices have consistently
          played a pivotal role in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). These
          practices serve as inspirations, challenges, and innovative avenues
          for learning and comprehension and extending 'traditional' HCI
          methods. While HCI often prioritises empirical evidence and practical
          outcomes, the art world emphasises diversity, process, and personal
          experiences. As generative artificial intelligence and
          interdisciplinary collaboration become increasingly prevalent, the
          relationship between art and HCI is undergoing a transformative shift
          currently, affecting how we make and think about things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tapestries have long been a means to record changing narratives,
          practices, memories, and identities and have a tradition of capturing
          narratives of transformation. And they, by tradition, a collaborative
          production of skilled crafts people. Inspired by these traditions, the
          Arts in HCI Tapestry meetup invites artists, designers, makers,
          technologists, researchers, educators, and anyone with an interest in
          collaborating to create a shared tapestry ‘beyond warp and weft’:
          Attendees are welcome to contribute various sensory elements to a
          tapestry on a paper surface (warp), including visual, tactile,
          auditory, kinaesthetic, gustatory, olfactory, cross-sensory, and
          social aspects (cartoons and weft). The completed tapestry serves as a
          collective narrative that encapsulates –“us” – the shared experiences
          of all participants.

        <h2>Goal of the Meet-up</h2>
        <p>
          The informal Arts in HCI Tapestry meetup is designed to foster active
          networking by sharing experiences, meeting new individuals, and
          identifying potential opportunities in research and funding grounded
          in shared artistic and creative interests. Attendees will co-create a
          physical tapestry through the exchange of diverse artistic and
          creative practices—visual, tactile, auditory, kinesthetic, gustatory,
          olfactory, cross-sensory, and social. The Arts in HCI Tapestry will
          serve as a visual and material representation of our collective
          practices in HCI, acting as both a boundary object and a shared
          artefact. Its creation will support meaningful networking, discussions
          around collaboration, and build a sense of community. The tapestry—a
          story of “us”—that can be carried forward and shared beyond the
          meetup.

        <h2>Description of the Community</h2>
        <p>
          The Arts in HCI Tapestry meet-up will facilitate the gathering of
          artists, researchers, educators, industry professionals, students, and
          other interested individuals in art practice within the context of
          HCI.

        <h2>Overview of the Meet-up</h2>
        <p>
          The Arts in HCI Tapestry meetup strikes a balance between the making,
          networking, and reflection. Float times have been added to ensure the
          smooth running of the meetup:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Part 1: Welcome, Introduction, and Prompt (10 minutes)</strong
            ><br />
            The session will commence with an introduction by the organisers,
            who will present the guiding prompt:
            <em
              >Your artistic practice in Human-Computer Interaction– past,
              present, and future.</em
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Part 2: Creating the Tapestry (60 minutes)</strong><br />
            Participants will contribute to a large, shared paper tapestry on
            the conference space wall. To enhance accessibility, the tapestry
            will be divided into sections around the room and assembled after
            the session. High-resolution photographs will be captured at each
            stage, and the tapestry will be woven together after the conference.
            As it evolves, participants can view others’ contributions, engage
            in discussions on AI, artistic identity, and interdisciplinary
            collaboration, and network and reflect on their practices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Part 3: Collective Reflection (20 minutes)</strong><br />
            Organisers and participants will gather to reflect on the completed
            tapestry, sharing insights, points of resonance, or new
            collaborations gained through networking and discussions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Arts in HCI Tapestry is designed for inclusivity, with adaptable
          spaces for quieter participation, wheelchair users, and seated
          engagement. Creative activities welcome diverse contributions,
          including from attendees with children, and both making and reflection
          are equally valued. The organisers will construct the completed
          tapestry, a tangible visual record of diverse creative practices in
          HCI. All actively contributing participants will be recognised as
          co-authors. An article or paper in SIGCHI will feature the tapestry
          and key themes, contextualising it within broader debates on art and
          HCI. These initiatives will engage attendees and record collaborative
          creativity in HCI.
