            <p>
                Throughout history, the arts and creative practices have consistently played a pivotal role in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). These practices serve as inspirations, challenges, and innovative avenues for learning and comprehension and extending 'traditional' HCI methods. While HCI often prioritises empirical evidence and practical outcomes, the art world emphasises diversity, process, and personal experiences. As generative artificial intelligence and interdisciplinary collaboration become increasingly prevalent, the relationship between art and HCI is undergoing a transformative shift currently, affecting how we make and think about things.

            <p>
                Tapestries have long been a means to record changing narratives, practices, memories, and identities and have a tradition of capturing narratives of transformation. And they, by tradition, a collaborative production of skilled crafts people. Inspired by these traditions, the Arts in HCI Tapestry meetup invites artists, designers, makers, technologists, researchers, educators, and anyone with an interest in collaborating to create a shared tapestry ‘beyond warp and weft’: Attendees are welcome to contribute various sensory elements to a tapestry on a paper surface (warp), including visual, tactile, auditory, kinaesthetic, gustatory, olfactory, cross-sensory, and social aspects (cartoons and weft). The completed tapestry serves as a collective narrative that encapsulates –“us” – the shared experiences of all participants.

            <div class="section-title">Goal of the Meet-up</div>
            <p>
                The informal Arts in HCI Tapestry meetup is designed to foster active networking by sharing experiences, meeting new individuals, and identifying potential opportunities in research and funding grounded in shared artistic and creative interests. Attendees will co-create a physical tapestry through the exchange of diverse artistic and creative practices—visual, tactile, auditory, kinesthetic, gustatory, olfactory, cross-sensory, and social. The Arts in HCI Tapestry will serve as a visual and material representation of our collective practices in HCI, acting as both a boundary object and a shared artefact. Its creation will support meaningful networking, discussions around collaboration, and build a sense of community. The tapestry—a story of “us”—that can be carried forward and shared beyond the meetup.

                The Arts in HCI Tapestry meet-up will facilitate the gathering of artists, researchers, educators, industry professionals, students, and other interested individuals in art practice within the context of HCI.

                The Arts in HCI Tapestry meetup strikes a balance between the making, networking, and reflection. Float times have been added to ensure the smooth running of the meetup:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Part 1: Welcome, Introduction, and Prompt (10 minutes)</strong><br>
                    The session will commence with an introduction by the organisers, who will present the guiding prompt: <em>Your artistic practice in Human-Computer Interaction– past, present, and future.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Part 2: Creating the Tapestry (60 minutes)</strong><br>
                    Participants will contribute to a large, shared paper tapestry on the conference space wall. To enhance accessibility, the tapestry will be divided into sections around the room and assembled after the session. High-resolution photographs will be captured at each stage, and the tapestry will be woven together after the conference. As it evolves, participants can view others’ contributions, engage in discussions on AI, artistic identity, and interdisciplinary collaboration, and network and reflect on their practices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Part 3: Collective Reflection (20 minutes)</strong><br>
                    Organisers and participants will gather to reflect on the completed tapestry, sharing insights, points of resonance, or new collaborations gained through networking and discussions.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The Arts in HCI Tapestry is designed for inclusivity, with adaptable spaces for quieter participation, wheelchair users, and seated engagement. Creative activities welcome diverse contributions, including from attendees with children, and both making and reflection are equally valued. The organisers will construct the completed tapestry, a tangible visual record of diverse creative practices in HCI. All actively contributing participants will be recognised as co-authors. An article or paper in SIGCHI will feature the tapestry and key themes, contextualising it within broader debates on art and HCI. These initiatives will engage attendees and record collaborative creativity in HCI.
